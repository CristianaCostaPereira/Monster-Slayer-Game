## Introduction & Gameplay
In this game, you will battle against an epic monster to see which one of you will be victorious.

Your powers will be your mighty clicks!

Press the `attack` or the `special attack` button to deal damage.

The monster will fight back! Beware!

If the monster is to strong, heal yourself so you do not lose your brave quest.

But, if you see your defeat ahead, you can succumb by `surrender` to the Monster and his power.

A battle log will display all of your fearless actions throughout each round, allowing you to keep track of the damage you dealt, the damage you received and for how much you healed.
